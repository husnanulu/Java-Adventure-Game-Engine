# Java-Adventure-Game-Engine
A text-based RPG engine demonstrating advanced OOP concepts like Polymorphism, Composition, and Inheritance in Java.

## Advanced Engineering Concepts
* **Polymorphism:** Utilizing method overriding for diverse NPC behaviors (Guards vs. Enemies).
* **Composition:** Creating complex world maps through dynamic Room and Player relationships.
* **Inheritance Hierarchy:** A robust architecture starting from an abstract `Entity` base class.
* **Encapsulation:** Ensuring data security and modularity through strict access control.

## Documentation & Analysis
You can access the full technical design and system analysis report directly from the repository files:

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
3. Use text commands like `go north`, `talk muhafız`, or `get key` to explore.
